Loss of renal function is the hallmark symptom of chronic kidney disease. The signs of the disease are not often obvious, and yet it is responsible for the loss of a substantial number of lives each year. When applied to medical research, the machine learning algorithm enables disease prediction with an extremely rapid turnaround time and a very high level of precision. The disease can be predicted by using four of the supervised classification learning algorithms, namely logistic regression, Decision tree, Linear Discriminant Analysis AdaBoostClassifier,GaussianNB and KNN algorithms. These algorithms are: logistic regression, Decision tree, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and KNN algorithms.

# Why early diagonosis is neccesary
Chronic kidney disease and renal failure are both difficult conditions to cure, and treatment is rarely successful. On the other hand, fewer than 5% of individuals diagnosed with early CKD report being aware of their disease. Whenever chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be detected, the damage to the glomeruli has already reached over 50% and is typically irreversible. The accurate prediction of chronic renal disease can be of great assistance in this regard. The usage of techniques from artificial intelligence can be applied to forecast diseases based on the data that is available from patients. For testing and medical diagnosis, clinicians and medical laboratories are necessary; nevertheless, artificial intelligence-based predictive technologies are utilised for early disease diagnosis. The application of ML could be very beneficial to society.
