Loss of renal function is the hallmark symptom of chronic kidney disease. The signs of the disease are not often obvious, and yet it is responsible for the loss of a substantial number of lives each year. When applied to medical research, the machine learning algorithm enables disease prediction with an extremely rapid turnaround time and a very high level of precision. The disease can be predicted by using four of the supervised classification learning algorithms, namely logistic regression, Decision tree, Linear Discriminant Analysis AdaBoostClassifier,GaussianNB and KNN algorithms. These algorithms are: logistic regression, Decision tree, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and KNN algorithms.
